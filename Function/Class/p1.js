//Syntax:

//function has two part: declaration and calling.
//function will not perform it's task until it is called. 

//Write 4 functions to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

function addition(){  //function declaration
  let a=10; b=20;
  console.log(a+b);
}

function subtraction(){  
  let x=10; y=20;
  console.log(x-y);
}

function multiplication(){
  let A=10; B=20;
  console.log(A*B);
}

function division(){
  let X=10; Y=20;
  console.log(X/Y);
}

multiplication(); //Calling the function
addition();
subtraction();
division();

//The process of calling the function is called invoking the function.
//The function declaration part is like function is sleeping and calling part is like the alarm.
